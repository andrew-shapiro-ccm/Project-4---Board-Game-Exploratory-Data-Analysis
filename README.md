# Project 4 - Board Game Exploratory Data Analysis

"How can we figure out ways to develop a successful board game?"

To answer this question, we have two methods: we can either do trial and error of different mechanics and genres, or we can use data analysis to figure out what made successful board games in the past and implement some of those mechanics and domains/genres into the development of the next board game. This study uses data from Board Game Geeks (BGG) and contains lots of information about the board game itself, year released, rating data, and the different mechanics and domains present for each of the board games. We will go ahead and analyze this data and use it to answer the data science questions below.

## 2 Data Science Questions

These are the two data science questions that I answered in this Project. 
1. What board game mechanics are successful in board games rated 8/10 or higher? 7/10 or higher? 6/10 or higher? Does increasing the scope change our results?
2. What board game domains/genres are successful in board games rated 8/10 or higher? 7/10 or higher? 6/10 or higher? Does increasing the scope change our results?

## Project Files

You can find 4 different project files in this GitHub Repository.
1. **BGG.csv** is the CSV file of the data from BoardGameGeeks (BGG). This file was not touched in any way, and it is the data that we will need to clean and analyze.
2. **CleanedBGG.csv** is the CSV file of the data from BGG after cleaning. It was cleaned in the Milestone2.ipynb file.
4. **Milestone2.ipynb** is the Jupyter Notebook file that we used to conduct some exploratory data analysis on the cleaned dataframe.
3. **Milestone3.ipynb** is the Jupyter Notebook file that we ran to clean our survey data file (CleanedBGG.csv) and it saved the cleaned CSV file as CleanedBGG.csv.
5. **Milestone4.ipynb** is the Jupyter Notebook file that analyzes the cleaned data in CleanedBGG.csv to answer the 4 data science questions. It showcases the commands used to clean up the data further for each question, plots the data in an easy to read format, and conducts an analysis for each of them, sometimes even adding more graphs and data analysis commands to create a better understanding or verify an analysis.
